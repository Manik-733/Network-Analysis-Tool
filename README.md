# Network Traffic Analysis for Anomaly Detection

## Project Description
This project demonstrates a simple network traffic analysis tool for detecting anomalies in packet sizes. It's designed as an educational tool to showcase basic data analytics and cybersecurity concepts using Python.
The script generates synthetic network traffic data and performs the following analyses:

## Data preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
Anomaly detection using Z-scores
Reporting of potential security threats

## Features

### Generate sample network traffic data
Visualize traffic patterns (protocol distribution, packet sizes, hourly traffic)
Detect anomalies in packet sizes using statistical methods
Generate a summary report of potential security threats

## Requirements

Python 3.7+
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scipy


## Install the required packages:
Copypip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy
