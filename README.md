# Network Traffic Analysis for Anomaly Detection

## Project Description
This project demonstrates a simple network traffic analysis tool for detecting anomalies in packet sizes. It's designed as an educational tool to showcase basic data analytics and cybersecurity concepts using Python.
The script generates synthetic network traffic data and performs the following analyses:

## Data preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
Anomaly detection using Z-scores
Reporting of potential security threats

## Features

## Generate sample network traffic data
Visualize traffic patterns (protocol distribution, packet sizes, hourly traffic)
Detect anomalies in packet sizes using statistical methods
Generate a summary report of potential security threats

##Requirements

Python 3.7+
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scipy

Installation

Clone this repository:
Copygit clone https://github.com/your-username/network-traffic-analysis.git
cd network-traffic-analysis

Install the required packages:
Copypip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy


Usage
Run the script using Python:
Copypython network_traffic_analysis.py
The script will generate sample data, perform analysis, display visualizations, and print a summary report.
Customization
You can customize the analysis by modifying the following parameters in the script:

num_records in generate_sample_data(): Change the number of records generated
threshold in detect_anomalies(): Adjust the sensitivity of anomaly detection
